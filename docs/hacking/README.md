# Hacking on the app

This chapter covers the internals of itch, serving as a reference both
for future itch.io team members and external contributors.

 * The [Getting started](./getting-started.md) page describes how have a working development copy of itch.
 * The [Data flow](./data-flow.md) page peeks into some architectural design decisions
 * The [Coding style](./coding-style) details not only conventions we follow, but also the ES2015 features we've chosen to use (what are style-guides if not blacklists of dangerous practices?)
 * The [Environment variables](./environment-variables.md) page describes the meaning of various environment variables used in development and helpful for tracking down problems.

And finally:

  * [Continuous deployment](./continuous-deployment.md) describes our entire deployment pipeline, along with details on our parallel test versions.
